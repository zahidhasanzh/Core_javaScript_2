//JavaScript has two long-standing ways to add comments to code.

/* The first way is the // comment; this makes all text following it on the
 same line into a comment. For example: */

// This is a one line JavaScript comment
// This is a one two JavaScript comment
// This is a one third JavaScript comment

//The second way is the /* */ style, which is much more flexible.
//For example, you can use it on a single line:

/*this is a comment
this is a comment
this is a comment
*/
